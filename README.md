# Statistics

Practice of the Statistics Module of the Bootcamp Big Data and Machine Learning

The objective of the practice is to use the  **R language** to process a Dataframe and obtain statistical information about the data

The **airbnb.csv** file is taken as an input and  a series of operations are requested to be performed on it and obtain data using the  **lenguaje R**. 

**Anaconda - Jupyter Notebook (R language)** is used for the development of this practice.

The **airbnb.csv** file contains information on tourist apartments in the city of Madrid.

Concepts dealt with in practice:

- Dataframe loading
- Add new columns to the dataframe
- Creation of new datraframes
- Dataframe cleaning
- Unique data visualization
- Data filtering
- Boxplots graphics
- Distributions
- Statistical tests
- Histograms
- Distribution Density Diagrams
- Linear model
- Correlation
